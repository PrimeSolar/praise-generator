/*
 * Praise Generator Script
 *
 * This script generates random praise messages. The generated message is displayed
 * in an HTML element with the identifier "praise", including the user's
 * name if provided. The message is then copied to the clipboard
 * for easy sharing. Also, when the praise is generated, confetti effects
 * are triggered to enhance the celebratory experience. The praise can be generated by either
 * pressing the "Enter" key or clicking the button.
